# The Robot Arm
  This project is primarly based on the [Adeept 5-DOF Robot Arm Kit](https://a.co/d/eUZHEkD). I also used the code as refrence as well. However, I couldn't find a online repository for the code.

# More to come
  This project is a long term one. I intend to keep it going for a good amount of time. I'm going to make everything open source.
